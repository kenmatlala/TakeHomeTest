# How to run code
Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. If it is not installed, you can download it from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
After installing Python, you can run the code on any integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. The code is designed to accept a number between 0 and 999999.
However, please note that due to time constraints, the code may not be complete.

# Worst-case space complexity 
There are multiple ways to approach the code, and creating one that is both efficient and concise is a challenge. When dealing with numbers that exceed ten thousand, the possible combinations of digits increase significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully analyze the problem and come up with a well-thought-out solution.
