## Documentation
    - The code features a class named Solution that incorporates a method called groupAnagrams. This method necessitates a list of      strings called strs as input and returns a list of lists of anagrams.

    - To group the anagrams, the method utilises a dictionary based on their sorted characters. Regrettably, there are no comments in the code to elucidate how the function works.

## Completeness
    -The code appears to be complete and functional. However, there is an error in the code that requires rectification. In the line x = "".join(sorted()), the sorted() function is called with no arguments. This will raise a TypeError since the function necessitates a list or string as input. Instead, it should be x = "".join(sorted(i)).

## Efficiency
    - Where N is the number of strings in the input list and K is the maximum length of a string. This is because the method employs a sorting algorithm to sort each string in the list, which has a time complexity of O(KlogK), and this operation is performed for each string in the list.

    - The space complexity of the method is also O(NK), as it utilises a dictionary to store the anagram groups, and the size of the dictionary can be up to N*K.

Overall, the code is functional. However, it would benefit from improved documentation and error handling. Furthermore, the efficiency could be enhanced by avoiding repeated sorting operations if feasible.
